### Training set 
On the training set, the **MAPE of 5.26%** reflects that, on average, the modelâ€™s predictions deviate by 5.26% from the true values. 
This implies that for a target value normalized between -1 and 1, *the average absolute deviation remains small, typically within the range of Â±0.0526 in scaled terms*. 

Similarly, the **RÂ² value of 0.9989** signifies that 99.89% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model, demonstrating a near-perfect fit. 

The **RMSE (0.0189)** quantifies the average magnitude of prediction errors, with its low value indicating minimal large errors, while the **MAE (0.0143)** shows that, on average, the modelâ€™s absolute prediction error remains close to 0.0143 in scaled terms.

### Validation set 
For the validation set, the **MAPE of 5.81%** suggests a slightly higher average percentage error on unseen data, which translates to a mean absolute deviation of approximately Â±0.0581 within the normalized range. This still reflects strong predictive capability. 

The **RÂ² value of 0.9988** indicates that 99.88% of the variance in the validation data is captured, confirming the model's ability to generalize effectively. 

The **RMSE (0.0208)** suggests that the modelâ€™s average prediction errors are slightly larger on unseen data, but still negligible in magnitude, and the **MAE (0.0163)** confirms consistently low absolute prediction errors.

These results imply that the model reliably predicts cyclical tops and bottoms within a small margin of error, even when applied to new data. The low MAPE ensures that deviations remain proportionally small, the high RÂ² demonstrates the strength of the model in explaining variability, and the low RMSE and MAE indicate that predictions are precise and consistent across both training and validation sets. 

This makes the Eclipse model a scientifically robust and practically reliable tool for forecasting market cycles.
